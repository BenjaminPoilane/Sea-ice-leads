# Sea-ice leads

Following files provide an a decetion algorithm for anisotropy in sea-ice leads around the North pole.
Analysis of satellite data using Copernicus Sentinels satellites imagery.

## Files

 - `SeaIce_01112002_15032003.gif` shows the sea ice concentration in the arctic ocean between Novembre 1st 2002 and March 15th 2003. Data, provided in 2014 by Ron Kwok (Jet propulsion Laboratory) comes from the RADARSAT constellation.
 - `anisotrypy_50km_01112002_15032003.gif` shows the anisotropy, at a 50 km scale, of the sea ice concentration shown on `SeaIce_01112002_15032003.gif`.
 - `anisotrypy_100km_01112002_15032003.gif` shows the anisotropy, at a 100 km scale, of the sea ice concentration shown on `SeaIce_01112002_15032003.gif`.

The anisotropy, at a given scale, of the sea ice concentration field tends to identify leads, of structured groups of leads whose sizes are close to the scale.
